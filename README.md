## üîç Objectives

- Clean inconsistent data (e.g., standardizing item fat content).
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - Total Sales
  - Average Sales
  - Total Number of Items
  - Average Ratings
- Analyze performance by:
  - Fat Content
  - Item Type
  - Outlet Type
  - Location Type
  - Establishment Year
- Visualize insights in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau dashboards.

## üßæ Key Findings

- **Low Fat** items generated higher total sales compared to **Regular** items, suggesting a strong customer preference for healthier options.
- **Snack Foods**, **Fruits and Vegetables**, and **Household Items** were the top 3 product categories by sales volume.
- Stores located in **Tier 1 cities** had the highest sales contribution, indicating better customer reach and urban demand.
- **Medium-sized outlets** contributed the largest share to total sales, followed by **small-sized** outlets.
- **Supermarket Type1** outlet types outperformed others in both total and average sales, making them the best-performing format.
- Outlets established in **1985 and 1987** had the highest historical performance, likely due to customer loyalty and maturity.
- The **average rating** across all products remained above 7.5, showing consistent customer satisfaction.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (SSMS, joins, aggregation, pivot)
- **Excel** (Pivot tables, charts, slicers)
- **Power BI** (DAX, interactive visuals)
- **Tableau** (Drag & drop visual analytics)

## üìä Visual Dashboards

- **Excel Dashboard**: Used pivot tables and slicers to analyze sales trends by outlet type and item categories.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Created interactive charts to explore sales by fat content, location type, and store size.
- **Tableau Dashboard**: Visualized geographical sales performance and item distribution across outlets.
